What do MC, MR, MS, M+, and M- in calculators do?

MC = Memory Clear sets the memory to 0
MR = Memory Recall uses the number in memory, acts as if you had keyed in that number yourself
MS = Memory Store puts the number on the display into the memory
M+ = Memory Add takes the number on the display, adds it to the memory, and puts the result into memory

The buttons can be handy for doing repeated calculations with a single number. For instance, if you wanted to multiply a bunch of numbers by pi, you could key in the following:

3.14159.. MS (stores the number)
4 x MR = (gives you 4 times pi)
25 x 25 x MR = (gives you 25x25 times pi)

The M+ button can be handy for figuring out complicated expressions if you don't happen to have a scientific calculator. For example, to calculate (5 x 6) + (12 x 2) + (3 x 7), you can do the following:

5 x 6 = (calculator says 30)
MS (stores 30 in memory)
12 x 2 = (calculator says 24)
M+ (takes 24, adds it to 30, stores result 54 in memory)
3 x 7 = (21)
M+ (takes 54, adds 21, stores the result 75)
MR (displays the result 75)
